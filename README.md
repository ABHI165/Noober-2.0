## üîç Features

**Common**
- üåê Network Request Tracking: Noober 2.0 provides detailed information about all network requests made from your app, including their responses. You can also share this information with others for debugging purposes.

- üìù Custom Logs: Easily add custom logs to display important data during debugging, such as analytics events fired within your app.

- üåê Change Base URL: Easily switch between different base URLs for network calls during debugging, streamlining testing in various environments.

- üîó Share User Properties via Deep Link: Share user properties stored in shared preferences (Android) or UserDefaults (iOS) with your teammates via deep links. This is especially useful for debugging and switching accounts without going through the authentication process repeatedly.

- üìä Show and Edit Saved User Properties: Noober allows you to view and edit saved user properties without the need for additional customization.

**Android**
- üì¶ Support for Multiple Shared Preferences: Noober 2.0 supports multiple shared preferences and encrypted shared preferences simultaneously.

- ü™≤ Auto-detect Crashes: Automatically detect crashes and display their stack traces in the Logs section. You can easily share crash details, including account information, via deep links.

- üßπ Clean Release Artifact: Ensure a clean release artifact with no traces of Noober in your final APK.



## üñá Getting Started

**Android**

Step 1: Configure Maven Repository

To get started with Noober 2.0 on Android:

Add the Noober 2.0 dependency to your app-level build.gradle file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    // For release builds
    releaseImplementation ("io.github.abhi165:noober-no-op-android:${version}")

    // For debug builds
    debugImplementation ("io.github.abhi165:noober-android:${version}")
    
    // Other dependencies...
}
```
**iOS**

To integrate Noober 2.0 into your iOS project, follow these steps:

Step 1: Add the following to your `~/.netrc` file (create the file if it doesn't exist):

```
machine maven.pkg.github.com
  login [github username]
  password [your new personal access token]
  ```

Step 2: In Xcode, go to File > Add Package Dependency.

Step 3: Enter the repository URL for Noober 2.0.

That's it! Noober 2.0 will be added to your iOS project, allowing you to enjoy the benefits of cross-platform debugging.

    
## üöÄ Initialization

**Android**

In your Application class:

```kotlin
Noober.start(this)
```
Add the NooberInterceptor to your OkHttpClient:
```kotlin
val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .addInterceptor(NooberInterceptor())
    .build()
```
**iOS**

In your AppDelegate:
```swift
Noober().start()
```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Additional Setup

**Android**
- Notification Permission: Starting with Android 13, you may need to request the android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission to display notifications when Noober tracks network activity.

**iOS**
- If you're using a 3rd-party library for network calls like Alamofire, add NoobProtocol to your URLSessionConfiguration:
```swift
let configuration: URLSessionConfiguration =  {
    let config = URLSessionConfiguration.default
    config.protocolClasses?.insert(Noober().getNoobProtocol()!, at: 0)
    return config
}()

```

- To handle deep links on iOS, follow these steps:

Step 1: Open Xcode and go to Project Settings -> Info.

Step 2: Add a URL Scheme with the value "noober."

Step 3: Call Noober().importAccountFromNoob(url: NSURL) from your SceneDelegate (or App Delegate if you don't have AppDelegate).

- To open Noober on iOS, you can use your own gesture and call Noober().toggle() or utilize Noober's UIWindow, which opens Noober when a shake gesture is detected. You can access the Noober window by calling Noober().getNoobWindow().

## üõ†Ô∏è Utilizing Additional Features
- To add logs, use:
```kotlin
Noober.log(tag: String, value: Any, isError: Boolean = false)

```

- To set user properties for sharing via deep link:
```kotlin
Noober.setUserProperties(prop: List<NoobUserProperties>))
```

`NoobUserProperties` is a data class containing two keys:

1. `key`: This is the identifier Noober uses to retrieve a specific data value (e.g., an authentication token) from shared preferences (Android) or UserDefaults (iOS).

2. `alternateKeyForCrossPlatform` (Optional): In cases where the same data has different key names on Android and iOS, this attribute helps Noober map the keys correctly when sharing and receiving data via deep links.
